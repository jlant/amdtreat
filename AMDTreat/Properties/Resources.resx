    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>

    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

STORAGE AND DISPENSING SYSTEM
This section allows users to develop cost estimates for the lime slurry storage and dispensing equipment. 

Electric Rate: This rate should reflect all costs associated with electric bill (i.e. fees, taxes, etc.).

Slurry Storage Tank: A 15 ft (height) by 10 ft diameter,  8,800 gallon  fiberglass tank is used in the cost model. This tank capacity is commonly used in the Eastern U.S. coal fields to take advantage of builk delivery and pricing of slurry. 

Slurry Refill Volume: Users select the  slurry delivery  volume which is used to estimate the refill frequency and  reserve capacity of the slurry system  (shown under Sizing Summary)

EPDM Rubber Tubing to Dispense Slurry: Users specifiy the distance between the slurry storage tank and the slurry dosing location to estimate the amount of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) tubing is required to dispense slurry. 

Stainless Slurry Agitator: A stainless steel mechnical agitator is fixed to the top of the slurry storage tank and used to keep slurry mixed and prevents solid/liquid separation.  Users specify how often the agitator operates and the power of the motor to estimtae the annual electrical consumption and cost. 

Chemical Metering Pump: Most slurry systems use two peristaltic pumps, a continiously dispensing and an emergency backup. Users specify how often the pumps operate and the power of the motor to estimtae the annual electrical consumption and cost.  

Hach se 200 pH-based Dispensing Controller: Users can include the cost of using a dispensing controller and pH  probe to automate  slurry  dosing using a  pH set point. 

Cellular Telemetry and Monthly Fee:  Users have the option to include the cost of adding telemetry for remote monitoring of the slurry treatment sysetm. 

Silicone Rubber Heat Blanket: SRP heat blankets are attached to the fiberglass tank and controlled by a themostat to prevent freezing of slurry. Four 2x3 ft SRP blankets are required to prevent slurry freezing in the  8,800 gallon fiberglass tank in Northern climates of the U.S.  Users must specify how many hours per day the heating blanket will operate during the winter months (Temp less than 40 degrees) for estimating annual electric costs. 

Tubing Heat Trace: The EPDM rubber tubing must be heat traced to prevent the slurry from freezing during winter months. Typically, the length of heat tape required is equal to the length of EPDM rubber tubing used to dispense slurry. Users must specify how many hours per day the heat trace will operate during the winter months (Temp less thann 40 degrees) for estimating annual electric costs. 


TANK FOUNDATION AND PUMP HOUSING
This section allows users to develop cost estimates of the concrete foundation for the slurry tank and for the shed that protects the electric panel, pumps, and controllers. 

Slurry Tank Foundation and Foundation Area: Users have the option of specifying the size of the slurry tank foundation or have AMDTreat estimate the foundation area.  The foundation size and cost estimates are provided in the "Sizing Summary" section. The default size for the fiberglass slurry tank is 15 ft height by 10 ft diameter tank. AMDTreat assumes the foundation is square shaped with a width and length that is 2 ft more than the diameter of the tank. The area is multiplied by the user-specified slab thickness to calculate the foundation volume. 

Pump and Electrical  Control Panel Housing: Typically, pumps and controllers are housed in an inexpensive pre-fabricated wooden garden shed with a pressure-treated 4x4 base.

Pre fab wooden shed on skids (no foundation) to house pumps and electrical control panel.

    <value>The various layers of a pond are contained within this section.  Each layer contains corresponding dimensions/properties and/or costs.

FREEBOARD
The depth of the Freeboard layer is defined as the difference between the top elevation of the berm and the design water surface elevation or top of limestone elevation, whichever is higher.  The purpose of the Freeboard layer is to accommodate a rising water surface elevation caused by increased flow or plugging in the limestone. 


WATER
The depth of the Water layer is defined as the difference between the bottom elevation of the Freeboard layer and the top elevation of the Limestone layer. The purpose of the water layer is to act as a barrier, but is typically not recommended in limestone beds.


LIMESTONE 
Upstream Depth is the depth of Limestone at the upstream or influent end of the Limestone Bed.  
Downstream Depth is the depth of Limestone at the downstream stream or effluent end of the Limestone Bed.

Purity represents the percentage of carbonate minerals by weight contained in limestone. It represents the portion of the limestone that will participate in reactions to increase pH and alkalinity. 

Dissolution Efficiency is a way to add additional limestone to a treatment system to help address a reduction in the rate of dissolution cause by a loss of reactive surface area as the limestone weathers over time. The mass of limestone will be divided by the dissolution efficiency to increase the mass of limestone. A dissolution factor of 85% will increase the mass of limestone by 17.6%.  A dissolution efficiency of 100% assumes 100% of the limestone will dissolve and will not alter the original mass of limestone. This factor can be considered a design safety factor.  

Limestone Porosity represents the percentage of void space compared to the total volume of the limestone layer. It also represents the portion of the limestone layer that will be occupied by water and not the limestone. This value affects retention time.

Limestone Unit Cost represents the cost to purchase and transport limestone to the mine drainage treatment site.

Limestone Placement Unit Cost represents the cost to install the limestone in the system.

PIPE
AMDTreat’s piping routine estimates the cost of the influent, limestone collection, and effluent piping network. AMDTreat calculates the cost of the influent and effluent pipe based on user entered length and unit cost, which is designed to convey water into and out of the treatment pond. The limestone collection piping network is installed at the base of the limestone layer and is designed to evenly direct water downward and/or horizontally throughout the limestone bed.  The limestone collection piping layout consists of a perforated “Header” pipe installed along the width at the downstream or effluent end of the limestone layer. The user can specifiy multiple Header pipes as desired to improve flow distribution and flushing and a perforated header pipe may also be specified for distributing the water from the influent pipe onto the limestone bed.  Conceptually, water flows towards and into the Header pipes and is conveyed to the effluent pipe for discharge to the water level control/flushing structure through the embankment. The routine calculates the number and cost of couplers used to connect segments of header pipes together and tees to connect influent and effluent pipes to the header pipe(s).  For more information on AMDTreat’s piping routine, including pictures, please refer to help. 
Influent/effluent Pipe Length represents the total amount of pipe required to deliver water into the treatment system and from the limestone collection system to the discharge point.  

Influent/effluent Install Rate is multiplied by the Influent/Effluent Pipe Length to estimate the amount of time required to install the pipe. Installation time is multiplied by the Labor Rate to estimate the installation cost. 

Header Pipe Segment Length represents the length of each segment of perforated header pipe. 

Header Pipe Quantity represents the number of perforated header pipes used in the system. Header pipes may be specified for both the influent to distribute flow into the limestone bed and the effluent to distribute flows throughout the width of the limestone bed moving in a horizontal- like flow pattern.

Header Pipe Install Rate is the rate that is multiplied by the Header Pipe Length to estimate the amount of time required to install the pipe. Installation time is multiplied by the Labor Rate to estimate the installation cost.

Labor Rate represents the unit cost of Labor. 

Influent/Effluent Pipe Unit Cost represents the cost of each linear foot of influent/effluent pipe.

Header Pipe Segment Unit Cost represents the cost of each linear foot of header pipe.

Header Pipe Coupler Unit Cost represents the cost of each coupler used to connect two header pipes together.

Tee Connector Unit Cost represents the cost of each Tee fitting used to connect the influent and/or effluent pipe to the perforated header pipe(s). 

Custom Pipe - The User-specified piping layout is used when users decide not to use AMDTreat’s piping routine to estimate the cost of the piping network. This routine allows users to specify the length and cost for various types of pipe and connectors. This routine may be helpful if users are attempting to “reverse cost” model an existing system with known quantities of pipe.

Custom Pipe Length represents the user-specified total length of pipe.

Custom Pipe Unit Cost represents the purchase and installation cost of each linear foot of pipe.

LINER
The liner routine allows users to estimate the cost of installing a Clay, Synthetic, or Geosynthetic Clay liner.

Clay Liner Unit Cost is the cost of purchasing, transporting, excavation, placing, and compacting the clay. In many cases, the only cost is the cost of excavating, placing, and compacting the clay.

Clay Liner Thickness is the desired thickness of the clay liner.

Synthetic Liner Unit Cost is the cost to purchase and install a synthetic liner. If using geotextile in conjunction with a clay liner, enter the unit cost for the geotextile here. If using synthetic liner with geotextile, add both unit costs and enter here.

Geosynthetic Clay Liner Unit Cost is the to purchase and install the geosynthetic clay liner.

Geosynthetic Clay Soil Cover Unit Cost is the cost to excavate and place the soil cover over the geosynthetic clay liner. 

Geosynthetic Clay Liner Soil Cover Thickness is the thickness of the protective soil cover over the geosynthetic clay liner.

The purpose of the Freeboard layer is to accommodate a rising water surface elevation caused by increased flow or plugging in the limestone. 

Depth of Freeboard Layer is from the top of berm/embankment to bottom of freeboard layer/top of limestone.

LIMESTONE 
The purpose of the Limestone layer in a Manganese Removal bed is to increase pH and alkalinity through the dissolution of limestone (calcite) and provide sufficient surface area for the establishment of biological organisms that oxidize the dissolved Manganese. 

Limestone Depth is the total depth of the Limestone layer making up the Manganese Removal Bed.
This depth is normally not as deep as the actual limestone bed to allow an interface between the air and water within the limestone bed for the biological organisms that perform the manganese oxidation.

Limestone Porosity represents the percentage of void space compared to the total volume of the limestone layer. It also represents the portion of the limestone layer that will be occupied by water and not the limestone. This value affects retention time.

Stone gradation allows the user to select the size range of limestone used in the layer based on four commonly used AASHTO sizes.  Porosity (void space) is assumed to be similar for the four sizes.

Limestone Unit Cost represents the cost to purchase and transport limestone to the mine drainage treatment site.

Limestone Placement Unit Cost represents the cost to place the limestone in the treatment pond to the desired bed depth.

The user can specifiy multiple Header pipes as desired to improve flow distribution and flushing and a perforated header pipe may also be specified for distributing the water from the influent pipe onto the limestone bed.  Conceptually, water flows towards and into the Header pipes and is conveyed to the effluent pipe for discharge to the water level control/flushing structure through the embankment. The routine calculates the number and cost of couplers used to connect segments of header pipes together and tees to connect influent and effluent pipes to the header pipe(s).  For more information on AMDTreat’s piping routine, including pictures, please refer to help.

    <value>RETENTION TIME
This sizing method uses Design Flow, user-specified retention time, and limestone porosity to calculate the volume of limestone required to retain the water for the specified retention time.  This tool tip should appear right next to the sizing method itself.

Retention Time is the desired retention time within limestone layer.

BUREAU Of MINES (BOM)
This sizing method performs two calculations to determine the mass of limestone. First, the mass of limestone needed to achieve the user-defined retention time is calculated. Next, the mass of limestone needed to neutralize the acidity load for the user-defined neutralization time period is calculated. These two masses are added together to calculate the total tons of limestone. This method ensures that the retention time in the limestone is always greater than the user-specified retention time, even at the very end of the neutralization time frame. 

System Life is the neutralization period is used to calculate the mass of limestone needed to neutralize the acidity load for the specified period of time.

ALKALINITY GENERATION RATE 
Calculates the mass of limestone needed in two steps. First, the surface area of limestone is calculated by dividing the alkalinity generation rate by the daily acidity load. Then the surface area is multiplied by the user-defined thickness of the limestone layer to calculate the volume of limestone, which is converted to mass. 

Alkalinity Generation Rate is the amount of acidity that will be loaded onto each m2 of limestone per day.

USER-SPECIFIED LIMESTONE

Spacing is the user specified spacing from center to center of each rock baffle. Typically one baffle is specified at the beginning and end of the wetland especially if an inlet pool and outlet pool are used on either end of the wetland.

Baffle Height is the height of the rock baffles is the vertical height from the bottom of the baffle, which is normally located on top of the compost mix layer to the top of the baffle at least equal to the surface of the free-standing water layer or higher. 

Limestone Void Space is the void space of the limestone material used to construct the rock baffles. AASHTO #1 size limestone is commonly used for rock baffles.

Limestone Unit Cost is the unit cost of delivered limestone material for use in constructing the rock baffles in wetland.

Limestone Placement Unit Cost is the unit cost to place the limestone material to form each rock baffle based on 2:1 side slopes and user specified height and spacing within the wetland.

PIPE
AMDTreat’s piping routine estimates the cost of the influent, limestone collection, and effluent piping network. AMDTreat estimtates the cost of the influent and effluent pipe, designed to convey water into and out of the treatment system. The limestone collection piping network is installed at the base of the limestone layer and is designed to evenly direct water downward throughout the system.  The limestone collection piping layout consists of a “Trunk” pipe installed along the length of the center of the limestone layer. Every twenty feet, smaller-diameter “spur” pipes extend outwards perpendicular from the Truck pipe towards the sides of the bed.  Conceptually, water flows towards and into the spur pipes and is conveyed to the trunk pipe for discharge to the effluent pipe through the embankment. The routine calculates the number and cost of couplers used to connect sections of trunk and spur pipes together and tees to connect spur pipes to the trunk pipe.  For more information AMDTreat’s piping routine, including pictures, please refer to help.

Influent/effluent Pipe Length represents the total amount of pipe required to deliver water into the treatment system and from the limestone collection system to the discharge point.  

Influent/effluent Install Rate is multiplied by the Influent/Effluent Pipe Length to estimate the amount of time required to install the pipe. Installation time is multiplied by the Labor Rate to estimate the installation cost. 

Header Pipe Segment Length represents the length of each segment of perforated header pipe. 

Header Pipe Quantity represents the number of perforated header pipes used in the system. Header pipes may be specified for both the influent to distribute flow into the limestone bed and the effluent to distribute flows throughout the width of the limestone bed moving in a horizontal- like flow pattern.

Header Pipe Install Rate is the rate that is multiplied by the Header Pipe Length to estimate the amount of time required to install the pipe. Installation time is multiplied by the Labor Rate to estimate the installation cost.

Labor Rate represents the unit cost of Labor. 

Influent/Effluent Pipe Unit Cost represents the cost of each linear foot of influent/effluent pipe.

SOIL COVER
The soil cover layer is the top layer used to serve as a barrier to keep atmospheric oxygen from the limestone layer in order to create the anoxic conditions necessary for the limestone drain to function as an ALD.

Soil Cover Depth is the user specified depth of soil cover layer placed over the limestone layer.

Soil Replacement Unit Cost is the unit cost to place the user specified depth of soil cover over the limestone layer.  Typically use suitable on-site topsoil material from the excavation for the ALD.

LIMESTONE 
The thickness of the Limestone layer in the VFP. The purpose of the Limestone layer is to increase pH and alkalinity through the dissolution of limestone (calcite).  

Purity represents the percentage of carbonate minerals by weight contained in limestone. It represents the portion of the limestone that will participate in reactions to increase pH and alkalinity. 

Dissolution Efficiency is a way to add additional limestone to a treatment system to help address a reduction in the rate of dissolution cause by a loss of reactive surface area as the limestone weathers over time. The mass of limestone will be divided by the dissolution efficiency to increase the mass of limestone. A dissolution factor of 85% will increase the mass of limestone by 17.6%.  A dissolution efficiency of 100% assumes 100% of the limestone will dissolve and will not alter the original mass of limestone. This factor can be considered a design safety factor.  

Limestone Porosity represents the percentage of void space compared to the total volume of the limestone layer. It also represents the portion of the limestone layer that will be occupied by water and not the limestone. This value affects retention time.

Limestone Unit Cost represents the cost to purchase and transport limestone to the mine drainage treatment site.

Limestone Placement Unit Cost is the placement cost of limestone represents the cost to place the limestone in the excavated limestone drain.

PIPE
AMDTreat’s piping routine estimates the cost of the influent, limestone collection, and effluent piping network. AMDTreat calculates the cost of the influent and effluent pipe based on user entered length and unit cost, which is designed to convey water into and out of the treatment pond. The limestone collection piping network is installed at the base of the limestone layer and is designed to evenly direct water downward and/or horizontally throughout the limestone bed.  The limestone collection piping layout consists of a perforated “Header” pipe installed along the width at the downstream or effluent end of the limestone layer. The user can specifiy multiple Header pipes as desired to improve flow distribution and flushing and a perforated header pipe may also be specified for distributing the water from the influent pipe onto the limestone bed.  Conceptually, water flows towards and into the Header pipes and is conveyed to the effluent pipe for discharge to the water level control/flushing structure through the embankment. The routine calculates the number and cost of couplers used to connect segments of header pipes together and tees to connect influent and effluent pipes to the header pipe(s).  For more information on AMDTreat’s piping routine, including pictures, please refer to help. 

Influent/effluent Pipe Length represents the total amount of pipe required to deliver water into the treatment system and from the limestone collection system to the discharge point.  

Influent/effluent Install Rate is multiplied by the Influent/Effluent Pipe Length to estimate the amount of time required to install the pipe. Installation time is multiplied by the Labor Rate to estimate the installation cost. 

Header Pipe Segment Length represents the length of each segment of perforated header pipe. 

Header Pipe Quantity represents the number of perforated header pipes used in the system. Header pipes may be specified for both the influent to distribute flow into the Mn Removal bed and the effluent to distribute flows throughout the width of the Mn Removal bed moving in a horizontal- like flow pattern.

    <value>RETENTION TIME
This sizing method uses Design Flow, user-specified retention time, and limestone porosity to calculate the volume of limestone required to retain the water for the specified retention time.  

Retention Time is the desired retention time within limestone layer.

BUREAU Of MINES (BOM)
This sizing method performs two calculations to determine the mass of limestone. First, the mass of limestone needed to achieve the user-defined retention time is calculated. Next, the mass of limestone needed to neutralize the acidity load for the user-defined neutralization time period is calculated. These two masses are added together to calculate the total tons of limestone. This method ensures that the retention time in the limestone is always greater than the user-specified retention time, even at the very end of the neutralization time frame. 

System Life is the neutralization period is used to calculate the mass of limestone needed to neutralize the acidity load for the specified period of time.

ALKALINITY GENERATION RATE 
Calculates the mass of limestone needed in two steps. First, the surface area of limestone is calculated by dividing the alkalinity generation rate by the daily acidity load. Then the surface area is multiplied by the user-defined thickness of the limestone layer to calculate the volume of limestone, which is converted to mass. 

Alkalinity Generation Rate is the amount of acidity that will be loaded onto each m2 of limestone per day.

USER-SPECIFIED LIMESTONE
This sizing method allows users to specify how much limestone is needed and the program uses other user-defined variables to calculate material quantities, volumes, and dimensions. 

Limestone Quantity is the user specified quantity of limestone to be used in tons.

    <value>Information about the Dry Lime Products.

Lime (quicklime) (CaO): Lime is manufactured as a &gt; 90% pure powder or pebble (pebble lime) by calcining high Ca-content limestone to exsolve CO2: CaCO3 + Heat = CaO + CO2.  Pebble lime can be added directly to a waste water stream, however, this method results in incomplete dissolution due to incomplete hydration and small surface area available for reaction. In most applications, lime is mixed with water in a slaker for conversion to hydrated lime before being added to a waste stream. Lime is typically lower cost than hydrated lime so many high capacity  treatment plants opt to purchase slakers to produce onsite hydrated lime as a cost control strategy instead of paying for manufactured hydrated lime. In recent years, the price gap between hydrated lime and lime has lessened, making the financial payback for the increased capital and operational cost of a slaker less appealing. 

Hydrated Lime (Ca(OH)2): Hydrated lime is a manufactured from limestone (CaCO3) as a &gt; 90% pure powder (&lt;1-45 um) in a two-step process. The first step involves calcining high Ca-content limestone in kilns at temperatures between 1,000 and 1,300 C for rapid decomposition and evolution of CO2 to produce quicklime (CaO). The second step involves hydrating, or "slaking' the quicklime to form Ca(OH)2.  Hydrated lime treatment systems can either dry feed the chemical directly into the wastewater stream or produce a slurry to facilitate pumping the chemical to a reaction tank.  Benefits of using a Ca(OH)2 slurry over dry CaO include particle deagglormeration, increased particle surface area, pumpability, and better dose control. 
 
Purity: Purity of  Lime or Hydrated Lime as % CaO or % Ca(OH)2. 

Dissolution Efficiency: Dissolution Efficiency is a way to account for additional CaO or Ca(OH)2 due to a loss of reactive chemical due to  incomplete dissolution of  particles typically associated with incomplete mixing.  For example, extremely short mixing retention times or dispensing slurry into non turbulent water may result in incomplete dissolution of lime particles. Dissolution efficiency is lowered when dry feeding pebble lime or applying lime products to higher pH  waste streams. 

Unit Cost Delivered: Unit cost of the purchase and delivery of Lime or Hydrated Lime

1. Storage and Dispensing System - This section allows users to develop cost estimates for either a complete (turnkey) lime (CaO) slaking or hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2) system (silo, bin vibrator, dust collection, screw feeder, slaker, slurry  tank, slurry pumps, slurry lines, heater, control panel, etc.). 

Electric Rate: This rate should reflect all costs associated with electric bill (i.e. fees, taxes, etc.).

Dust Collector Blower: The dust collector blower is used to control lime dust when the silo is refilled with lime product. As a result, the electrical demand to operate the blower is calculated by multiplying the Silo Refill Frequency by the Time to Refill the Silo. The annual electrical cost to operate the blower is estimated using the user-specified motor horsepower and the operation period.

Bin Activator/Vibrator: A bin activator/vibrator is an electrical motor used to promote the flow of lime products from the silo to the screw feeder and prevent "bridging" of lime across the silo. Typically the vibrators turn on and vibrate the silo every 5 to 10 mins for a 30 second period.  The annual electrical cost to operate the bin vibrator is estimated using the user-specified motor horsepower and the operation period.

Screw Feeder: An electrical motor is used to operate an auger to volumetrically dispense lime products to the slurry tank/slaker. The screw feeder only operates when the level of the slurry in the slurry tank drops to a level that calls for lime and water to be added to the tank.   The annual electrical cost to operate the screw feeder is estimated using the user-specified motor horsepower and the operation period .

Slurry Mixer: A mixer/agitator is fixed to the slurry tank to keep the slurry mixed and prevent separation.  The annual electrical cost to operate the slurry mixer is estimated using the user-specified motor horsepower and the operation period.

Slurry Pump:  The slurry pump is used to pump the slurry to the dosing point. The annual electrical cost to operate the slurry pump is estimated using the user-specified motor horsepower and the operation period.

Silo Exhaust Fan: An exhaust fan is used to evacuate air from inside the silo to promote a clean environment. The annual electrical cost to operate the exhaust fan is estimated using the user-specified motor horsepower and the operation period.


Silo Space Heater: The heater is only operated during the cold months to prevent freezing conditions near the slurry tank.  The annual electrical cost to operate the heater is estimated using the user-specified power consumption of the heater and the operation period. 



2. Foundation - This section allows users to estimate the cost of constructing a foundation for the Lime Silo system. 

AMDTreat automatically selections the appropriate length and width of the foundation based on the size of the silo system selected. The thickness of the foundation depends on the geotechnical qualities of the soil. Excellent soils require a foundation thickness of 2.6 ft thick foundation, Average soils require 3.5 ft and Poor requires 5.25 ft. The foundation volume is multiplied by the Concrete Cost and Placement unit cost to estimate the total cost of the foundation. The Concrete Cost and Placement considers the cost of purchase, delivery, forms, rebar, placed, and finished for foundation</value>

The limestone collection piping network is installed at the base of the limestone layer and is designed to evenly direct water downward throughout the system.  The limestone collection piping layout consists of a “Trunk” pipe installed along the length of the center of the limestone layer. Every twenty feet, smaller-diameter “spur” pipes extend outwards perpendicular from the Truck pipe towards the sides of the bed.  Conceptually, water flows towards and into the spur pipes and is conveyed to the trunk pipe for discharge to the effluent pipe through the embankment. The routine calculates the number and cost of couplers used to connect sections of trunk and spur pipes together and tees to connect spur pipes to the trunk pipe.  For more information AMDTreat’s piping routine, including pictures, please refer to help.

Influent/effluent Pipe Length represents the total amount of pipe required to deliver water into the treatment system and from the limestone collection system to the discharge point.  

Influent/effluent Install Rate is multiplied by the Influent/Effluent Pipe Length to estimate the amount of time required to install the pipe. Installation time is multiplied by the Labor Rate to estimate the installation cost. 

Labor Rate represents the unit cost of Labor.
